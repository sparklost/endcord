### OS specific keybindings
Some keybindings are used by terminals or OS itself, so they are by default rebound to something else.

### Windows:

- `Ctrl+A` - Expand selected categories and servers
- `Alt+Y` - View attached media (image, gif, video, audio)

### macOS:
- `Shift+Up/Down` - Navigating channel tree
- `Alt+O` - Open link in browser


## Mouse controls
### Double click in:
- Tree - or enter channel
- Extra window - select item
- Member list - view member profile
- Input line - select a word

### Double click in chat on:
- Message time - start replying to message
- Message reply line - go to that message
- Username - view profile
- Reaction - toggle that reaction
- URL - open media / download file / open in browser
- Spoiler - reveal that spoiler
- User mention - view profile of mentioned user
- Channel - go to that channel

### Other
- Scroll up/down in all windows
- Single click to select in all windows, in tree also: un/collapse
- Single click on tab string to switch tabs (only if exactly `format_title_line_r = "%tabs"` in config)

On Windows, double click isn't working, instead use triple click.


## Configuring keybindings
### Standard keybindings
Keybindings are configured in separate sections in `config.ini`.  Main keybindings section is `[keybindings]`.  
Key combinations are saved as integer codes, that can be generated by running `endcord -k`.  
`Alt+Key` codes are stored as string with format: `"ALT+[KEY]"`, where `[KEY]` is integer.
On Windows they are integers but `ALT+Key` string in keymap will still work.  
In xterm they are also integers (not the same as on Windows) and `ALT+Key` string in keymap will still work.  
`Ctrl+Shift+Key` combinations are not supported by most terminal emulators, but `Alt+Shift+Key` are.  
Keybindings can also be chained like this (maximum 2 bindings in chain, separated with `-`):  
`"25-97"` for `Ctrl+X-A` which means: press `Ctrl+X` then `A`, `"ALT+120-ALT+100"` for `Alt+X-Alt+D` and so on.  
To specify multiple keybindings for same action put them in a tuple, eg.: `(2, "25-97", "ALT+120")`.  
Switch tab keybinding is special - `NUM` is placeholder for 1-9 number keys, eg.:`ALT+NUM` or `ALT+120-NUM`.  

### Configuring vim mode keybindings
Keybindings for vim mode are configured in section `[vim_mode_bindings]` can be typed as characters but they must be in "". Eg.: `"edit" = "e"`.  
Alternatively key codes can be used too. When specifying chained or multiple bindings, key codes must be used!   
There is one special keybinding, used only in vim mode: `"insert_mode" = "i"`.  
Command bindings can also use vim mode bindings, but they must be typed as key codes in quotes!

### Command keybinding (macros)
There is additional section `[command_bindings]`, used to make custom client command string or even macros executed when keybinding is pressed.  
Command keybinding is added like this: `"25" = "send_message Hello World!"`. This will execute that command when `Ctrl+X` is pressed.  
Note that all bindings must be inside quotes, even a single integer. To use same binding as standard keybindings, set stadard keybinding to `None`.  
Alongside commands, standard keybinding names can be used here too. Eg. `"25" = "tree_up; tree_up"` will "press" tree_up binding twice.  
To execute multiple commands in a sequence, type them spearated with `;` character. To use actual `;` character in command type it as `\;`.  
Special commands availabe only for command-bindings are documented in [Commands list](commands.md#command-bindings-only-commands).
